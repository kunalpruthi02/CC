            Chess is a <strong>board</strong> game for two players.It is sometimes called <em>international chess or Western chess</em> to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess).
            Chess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is played on a chessboard with 64 <abbr title="Square">sq.</abbr> arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid.

        <h1>Check and checkmate</h1>
        <p>
            When a king is under immediate attack, it is said to be in check. A move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position where the king is no longer in check. There are three ways to counter a check:

        <h3>Tournaments and matches</h3>
        <p>Tournaments with a small number of players may use the round-robin format, in which every player plays one game against every other player. For a large number of players, the Swiss system may be used, in which each player is paired against an opponent who has the same (or as similar as possible) score in each round. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="sidelock">
        <p>In either case, a player's score is usually calculated as 1 point for each game won and one-half point for each game drawn. Variations such as "football scoring" (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw) may be used by tournament organizers.</p>
